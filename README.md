# slymap
slymap is a locally hosted website and service where you can add your own maps (for exmaple game maps). Using the Leaflet.js API, users can zoom in and put markers on the map for strategical visualisation. The service is using socket.io to sync, in real-time, the markers that are being put on the map. So every user on the website will be able to share their strategies.

This is a work in progress, very early days. It is not properly scaled yet and is lacking some features.
